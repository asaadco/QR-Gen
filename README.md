# QR-Gen
Quarterly Report Generator developed internally during my internship in Saudi Aramco (Which has an extremely strict IT limitation, many nights were spent installing libraries offline in Anaconda by copy and pasting). QR Gen saved our unit a week time of editing and staying overtime. Can be customized to generate your own report in seconds if it follows a consistent structure!

Features:
* Generation of Word documents through Python-Docx
* PyQT5 User Interface
* Face detection and cropping using dlib (Optional)
* Fuzzy Matching for attachment names (Optional)

I'd like to thank Amjad & Aisha for their support in delivering this project. This project along with other two projects has caused cost savings of $500,000 annually by streamlinig their business processes.
